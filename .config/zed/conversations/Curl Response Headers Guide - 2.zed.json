There are a few ways to do this depending on your specific needs.\n\n## Basic Command to View All Headers\n\nThe simplest approach is to use the `-i` (or `--include`) flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -i https://example.com\n```\n\nThis will display both the response headers and the response body in your terminal output.\n\n## Headers Only (No Response Body)\n\nIf you only want to see the headers without the response body, use the `-I` (or `--head`) flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -I https://example.com\n```\n\nThis performs a HEAD request rather than a GET request.\n\n## More Verbose Output\n\nFor even more detailed information including request headers, use the `-v` (verbose) flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -v https://example.com\n```\n\nThe verbose output will show:\n- Request headers (prefixed with `>`)\n- Response headers (prefixed with `<`)\n- Additional connection information\n- The response body\n\n## Saving Headers to a File\n\nTo save headers to a file while displaying the body normally:\n\n```bash\ncurl -D headers.txt https://example.com\n```\n\nThis writes headers to `headers.txt` while showing only the body in the terminal.\n\n## Production Tips\n\n1. **For API debugging in CI/CD pipelines**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -v -s -o /dev/null https://api.example.com/endpoint\n   ```\n   This shows headers but redirects the body to `/dev/null` (-s silences progress meters)\n\n2. **For monitoring HTTP status codes**:\n   ```bash\n   status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" https://example.com)\n   if [ \"$status\" -ne 200 ]; then\n     echo \"Error: Service returned $status\"\n   fi\n   ```\n\n3. **To follow redirects and see all headers in the chain**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -L -v https://example.com\n   ```\n\n4. **For a more structured output**, you can use a tool like `jq` with the right curl formatting:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -D - https://api.example.com | grep -v \"^$\" | head -n 10 | sed 's/^/    /'\n   ```\n\nThese commands should cover most scenarios where you need to inspect response headers in development, debugging, or monitoring contexts.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":1408,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":33}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":3500,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":34}}}],"summary":"Curl Response Headers Guide","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
