The Hyper key is essentially Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Cmd/Win pressed simultaneously.\n\n## Steps to Map K to Hyper+K:\n\n1. Open VIA and connect your keyboard\n2. Go to the \"Configure\" tab\n3. Find the \"K\" key on the keyboard layout \n4. Click on the \"K\" key to select it\n\n## Option 1: Using a QMK Hyper Key:\n1. In the key selection menu, look for the \"Special\" or \"Quantum\" category\n2. Select \"Hyper\" (which combines Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win/Cmd)\n3. Then go to \"Any\" category and type \"K\" to select the K key\n4. This creates a sequence where Hyper is pressed, then K\n\n## Option 2: If VIA doesn't have direct Hyper support:\nCreate a custom combo by selecting:\n1. Go to \"Macro\" tab\n2. Create a new macro\n3. Add these keystrokes in sequence:\n   - Press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Win/Cmd (all together)\n   - Press K\n   - Release K\n   - Release Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Win/Cmd\n4. Assign this macro to the K key\n\n## Note:\n- Not all VIA versions or keyboards fully support Hyper key or complex macros\n- You may need to use QMK Configurator instead for more advanced custom keymaps\n- Some keyboards may require you to flash custom firmware to enable this functionality\n\nWould you like more specific instructions for your particular keyboard model?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":79}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":64},"start":102,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":80}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":65},"start":1455,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":81}}}],"summary":"VIA Key Remapping for Hyper Key","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
