Instead, you can achieve ternary-like operations in two main ways:\n\n1. Using and/or operators:\n```lua\nlocal result = condition and trueValue or falseValue\n```\n\nExample:\n```lua\nlocal age = 20\nlocal status = age >= 18 and \"adult\" or \"minor\"\n```\n\n2. Using an if-else statement (when the logic is more complex):\n```lua\nlocal result = if condition then trueValue else falseValue end\n```\n\nHowever, be careful when using the and/or method because it might not work as expected if your trueValue is false or nil. In such cases, it's better to use an if-else statement:\n\n```lua\nlocal value = if condition then\n    -- complex logic here\n    return trueValue\nelse\n    return falseValue\nend\n```\n\nThe and/or method is more concise but should be used carefully and mainly for simple conditions where the trueValue is never false or nil.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":23}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":30,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":24}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":998,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":25}}}],"summary":"Lua Ternary Operation Inquiry","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
