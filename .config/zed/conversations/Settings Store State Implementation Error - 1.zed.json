Here are a few potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. Missing Initialization:\nMake sure the SettingsStore is properly initialized before being accessed. Check if you have:\n\n```rust\nlet settings = SettingsStore::new();\n```\n\n2. Scope Issues:\nVerify that the SettingsStore is in scope where you're trying to use it. It might need to be passed as a parameter or accessed through the proper context.\n\n3. Import Issues:\nEnsure you have the correct imports:\n\n```rust\nuse settings::settings_store::SettingsStore;\n```\n\n4. Lifetime Issues:\nIf you're storing the SettingsStore in a struct, make sure any lifetime parameters are properly specified.\n\n5. Build/Cargo Issues:\n- Try cleaning and rebuilding the project:\n```bash\ncargo clean\ncargo build\n```\n\nWithout seeing more of your code context, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.
