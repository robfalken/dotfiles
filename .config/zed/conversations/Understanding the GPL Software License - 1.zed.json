Here are its key principles:\n\n1. Freedom to use: Users can run the software for any purpose\n\n2. Freedom to study and modify: Users can access and modify the source code\n\n3. Freedom to share: Users can distribute copies of the software\n\n4. Freedom to distribute modifications: Users can share their modified versions\n\nThe most important aspect is the \"copyleft\" provision: If you distribute GPL-licensed software or create derivative works, you must:\n- Make the source code available\n- License the derivative work under the GPL\n- Preserve the same freedoms for others\n\nThis creates a \"viral\" effect ensuring that software derived from GPL-licensed code remains free and open source. It prevents companies from taking GPL code, modifying it, and releasing it as proprietary software.\n\nThe GPL is one of the most popular open source licenses, used by projects like Linux, WordPress, and many GNU tools.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":23}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":41,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":24}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":1066,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":25}}}],"summary":"Understanding the GPL Software License","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
