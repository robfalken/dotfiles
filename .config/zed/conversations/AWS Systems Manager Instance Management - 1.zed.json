This is a significant security and operational management feature in AWS.\n\nKey aspects of SSM-managed instances:\n\n1. Security Benefits:\n- No need for direct SSH/RDP access to instances\n- No requirement to maintain bastion hosts\n- No need to manage SSH keys\n- Centralized access control through IAM policies\n- All actions are logged in AWS CloudTrail\n\n2. Technical Requirements:\n- EC2 instance must have SSM Agent installed\n- Proper IAM role attached with necessary SSM permissions\n- Network connectivity to SSM endpoints (either through internet or VPC endpoints)\n\n3. Management Capabilities:\n- Remote command execution\n- Automated patching\n- Software inventory\n- Configuration management\n- Session management through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager\n\nFrom an ISO27001 perspective, using SSM-managed instances helps satisfy several controls:\n- Access Control (A.9)\n- Operations Security (A.12)\n- System acquisition, development and maintenance (A.14)\n\nThis approach aligns with security best practices by reducing the attack surface and providing better audit capabilities for compliance requirements.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":240,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":1537,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":47}}}],"summary":"AWS Systems Manager Instance Management","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":181},"icon":"Library","label":"InfoSec expert","metadata":null}]}
