This can happen for several reasons:\n\n1. The table name is misspelled\n2. The table hasn't been created yet\n3. You're connected to the wrong database\n4. The table exists in a different schema\n5. The table was deleted\n6. You don't have proper permissions to see the table\n7. You haven't specified the correct schema (if you're not using the default 'public' schema)\n\nTo fix this, you can:\n\n1. Check the exact table name:\n```sql\n\\dt    -- Lists all tables in current schema\n\\dt *  -- Lists all tables in all schemas\n```\n\n2. Create the table if it doesn't exist:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE table_name (\n    column1 datatype,\n    column2 datatype,\n    ...\n);\n```\n\n3. Check which database you're connected to:\n```sql\nSELECT current_database();\n```\n\n4. Check the schema:\n```sql\nSELECT current_schema;\nSHOW search_path;\n```\n\n5. Fully qualify the table name with schema:\n```sql\nschema_name.table_name\n```\n\nExample: `public.users` instead of just `users`\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":33}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":72,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":34}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":1132,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":35}}}],"summary":"Missing Table in PostgreSQL Database","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
