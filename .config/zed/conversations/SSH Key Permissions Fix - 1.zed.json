This is a security measure to ensure your private keys are protected. Here's how to fix it:\n\nFor Linux/MacOS:\n```bash\n# Change permissions on your private key to be readable only by you\nchmod 600 your_private_key_file\n# Or even more restrictive\nchmod 400 your_private_key_file\n```\n\nQuick explanation of the permission numbers:\n- 600: Owner can read and write\n- 400: Owner can read only\n\nFor example, if your key is in the default location:\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n# Also secure the .ssh directory itself\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\n```\n\nFor Windows:\nIf you're using Windows, you'll need to adjust the file permissions through:\n1. Right-click on the key file\n2. Properties\n3. Security tab\n4. Advanced\n5. Disable inheritance\n6. Remove all permissions except for your user account\n\nCommon locations for SSH keys:\n```\nLinux/MacOS: ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nWindows: C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.ssh\\id_rsa\n```\n\nAdditional security best practices:\n```bash\n# Check current permissions\nls -la ~/.ssh/\n\n# Ensure proper ownership\nchown $USER:$USER ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n# Secure the entire .ssh directory\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/config    # if you have a config file\n```\n\nIf you're using this for Git/GitHub, after fixing permissions, test with:\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nIf you still have issues after applying these changes, you might need to:\n1. Check if SELinux/AppArmor is affecting permissions\n2. Verify the key file is in the correct format\n3. Ensure your SSH agent is running properly\n\nLet me know if you need help with any specific platform or setup!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":43}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":2067,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":2140,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":3779,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}}],"summary":"SSH Key Permissions Fix","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":2037},"icon":"Library","label":"Engineering","metadata":null}]}
