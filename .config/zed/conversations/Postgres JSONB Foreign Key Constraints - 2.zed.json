For example, if you have:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY);\n\nCREATE TABLE posts (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  data JSONB -- Contains { \"author_id\": 123 }\n);\n```\n\nYou cannot directly create a constraint like:\n```sql\n-- This won't work\nALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT fk_author\n  FOREIGN KEY (data->>'author_id') REFERENCES users(id);\n```\n\n## Practical Solutions\n\n### 1. Extract the Value to a Dedicated Column\n\nThe most robust solution is to store the foreign key value in both places:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE posts (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  author_id INT REFERENCES users(id),\n  data JSONB\n);\n\n-- Enforce consistency with triggers\nCREATE FUNCTION sync_author_id() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  -- Keep column and JSON in sync\n  NEW.data = jsonb_set(NEW.data, '{author_id}', to_jsonb(NEW.author_id));\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nCREATE TRIGGER posts_author_sync\n  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON posts\n  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_author_id();\n```\n\n### 2. Use Check Constraints with Subqueries\n\nFor PostgreSQL 12+:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT check_author_id \n  CHECK ((data->>'author_id')::INT IN (SELECT id FROM users));\n```\n\nHowever, this isn't a true foreign key as it:\n- Won't update/cascade if the parent record changes\n- Has performance implications\n- Won't enforce ON DELETE rules\n\n### 3. Application-Level Validation\n\nHandle this in your application code:\n\n```ruby\n# Rails example\nclass Post < ApplicationRecord\n  validate :author_must_exist\n\n  private\n  \n  def author_must_exist\n    author_id = data&.dig('author_id')\n    if author_id.present? && !User.exists?(author_id)\n      errors.add(:data, \"references non-existent author_id\")\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### 4. Triggers for Comprehensive Validation\n\n```sql\nCREATE FUNCTION validate_post_author() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF (NEW.data->>'author_id') IS NOT NULL AND \n     NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = (NEW.data->>'author_id')::INT) THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Author ID % does not exist', (NEW.data->>'author_id');\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nCREATE TRIGGER check_post_author\n  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON posts\n  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_post_author();\n```\n\n## Recommendation\n\nFor production systems where referential integrity is critical, I recommend approach #1 - maintaining a dedicated column with a proper foreign key alongside the JSONB data. This gives you the best of both worlds:\n\n- Full foreign key constraint benefits (cascades, performance)\n- Ability to index and query efficiently\n- Flexibility to keep the relationship data in your JSON documents\n\nThe slight denormalization is a worthwhile tradeoff for the integrity and performance benefits.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":94}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":35},"start":1427,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":95}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":36},"start":4473,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":96}}}],"summary":"Postgres JSONB Foreign Key Constraints","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
