Here are the steps for different scenarios:\n\nFor Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):\n\n1. If you installed using the install script:\n```bash\n# Remove NVM directory\nrm -rf ~/.nvm\n\n# Remove NVM entries from ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.zshrc\n# Open these files and delete any lines containing NVM\n```\n\n2. Also remove these lines from your shell's rc file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):\n```bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\nFor Windows:\n\n1. If you installed using Windows installer:\n```bash\n# Remove NVM directory\nrmdir /s /q \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\nvm\"\n\n# Remove NVM for Windows installation directory\nrmdir /s /q \"C:\\Program Files\\nvm\"\n```\n\n2. Remove environment variables:\n- Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables\n- Remove NVM_HOME and NVM_SYMLINK from System Variables\n- Remove their entries from the Path variable\n\nAfter uninstalling:\n1. Restart your terminal/command prompt\n2. Verify NVM is removed by typing:\n```bash\ncommand -v nvm  # Unix-based systems\nwhere nvm      # Windows\n```\n\nIf it returns nothing, NVM has been successfully uninstalled.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":27}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":27,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":1402,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}}}],"summary":"","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
