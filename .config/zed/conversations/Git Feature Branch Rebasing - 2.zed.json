I'll outline the simplest approaches.\n\n## Option 1: Interactive Rebase from the Base Branch\n\nIf your feature branch was created from another branch (like `main` or `develop`), this is the easiest approach:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you're on your feature branch\ngit rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD main)\n```\n\nThis finds the common ancestor between your feature branch and main, then starts an interactive rebase from that point.\n\n## Option 2: Rebase to a Specific Number of Commits\n\nIf you know how many commits are in your feature branch:\n\n```bash\n# To rebase the last 5 commits on your branch\ngit rebase -i HEAD~5\n```\n\n## Option 3: Using Commit Hashes\n\nIf you know the SHA of the first commit in your feature branch:\n\n```bash\n# Find the commit hash\ngit log --oneline\n\n# Then rebase to the commit just before your first feature commit\ngit rebase -i <commit-hash>^\n```\n\nThe `^` syntax means \"the parent of this commit\".\n\n## Option 4: For Complex History\n\nIf your branch history is complex:\n\n```bash\n# Find the branch point\ngit log --graph --oneline --all\n\n# Once you identify the commit hash where your branch begins\ngit rebase -i <commit-hash>\n```\n\n## Pro Tip\n\nIf you want to maintain a cleaner workflow for future features, create branches with:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b feature-branch <base-branch>\n```\n\nThis makes the relationship between branches explicit and makes rebasing easier.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or explain what to do during the interactive rebase process?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":98}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":1432,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":99}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":44},"start":3097,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":100}}}],"summary":"Git Feature Branch Rebasing","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
