The trait likely has a lifetime parameter. Here's how to fix it:\n\n```rust\nstruct Consumer {}\nimpl pg_worker::Consumer for Consumer {\n    async fn perform<'a>(&'a self, payload: Value) -> Result<()> {\n        println!(\"PL {:?}\", payload);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe key change is adding the lifetime parameter `<'a>` to the method signature. This is needed if the trait definition includes a lifetime parameter in its `perform` method.\n\nIf this doesn't match your trait definition exactly, you might want to check the exact signature in the `pg_worker::Consumer` trait definition and ensure your implementation matches it precisely, including any lifetime parameters or bounds it specifies.\nThis is the trait definition\n```\nlifetime parameters or bounds on method `perform` do not match the trait declaration\n\nCould you share the trait definition from `pg_worker::Consumer`? It would help me provide the exact matching implementation. The error suggests there's a mismatch between how the lifetimes are declared in the trait and in your implementation.\n\nWithout seeing the trait definition, I can only guess. Try these possible solutions:\n\n1. If the trait has no lifetime parameters:\n```rust\nstruct Consumer {}\nimpl pg_worker::Consumer for Consumer {\n    async fn perform(&self, payload: Value) -> Result<()> {\n        println!(\"PL {:?}\", payload);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Or if the trait uses a specific lifetime:\n```rust\nstruct Consumer {}\nimpl pg_worker::Consumer for Consumer {\n    async fn perform<'a>(&'a self, payload: Value) -> Result<()> {\n        println!(\"PL {:?}\", payload);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCould you share the trait definition so I can provide the exact matching implementation?\n#[async_trait]\npub trait Consumer {\n    async fn perform(&self, payload: Value) -> Result<()>;\n}\nAh, now I see! The issue is that you need to use the `#[async_trait]` attribute macro on your implementation as well. This is required because Rust doesn't natively support async trait methods. Here's the correct implementation:\n\n```rust\n#[async_trait]\nstruct Consumer {}\n\n#[async_trait]\nimpl pg_worker::Consumer for Consumer {\n    async fn perform(&self, payload: Value) -> Result<()> {\n        println!(\"PL {:?}\", payload);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure you have the `async-trait` dependency in your `Cargo.toml` and the following import at the top of your file:\n```rust\nuse async_trait::async_trait;\n```\n\nThe `#[async_trait]` attribute macro handles the lifetime parameters internally by transforming the async trait method into a form that Rust can understand.\nHow can I define a trait so that a property is required?\nIn Rust, you can define a trait with required properties (also called associated items or associated types) in two ways:\n\n1. Using associated types:\n```rust\ntrait MyTrait {\n    type PropertyType;  // Associated type\n}\n```\n\n2. Or more commonly, using regular methods (getters):\n```rust\ntrait MyTrait {\n    fn get_property(&self) -> String;  // Required property via getter method\n}\n```\n\nHere's a complete example:\n```rust\ntrait Person {\n    fn name(&self) -> &str;  // Required property accessed via method\n    fn age(&self) -> u32;    // Another required property\n}\n\nstruct Employee {\n    name: String,\n    age: u32,\n}\n\nimpl Person for Employee {\n    fn name(&self) -> &str {\n        &self.name\n    }\n    \n    fn age(&self) -> u32 {\n        self.age\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRust traits don't support field declarations directly like some other languages (e.g., Java interfaces with fields), so we typically use methods to expose properties.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":293}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":398,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":294}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1255,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":295}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":51},"start":1284,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":296}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":64},"start":1288,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":297}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":85},"start":1374,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":298}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":86},"start":2275,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":299}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":158},"start":2372,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":300}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":159},"start":3145,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":301}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":279},"start":3202,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":302}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":280},"start":4132,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":303}}}],"summary":"Trait Lifetime Parameter Mismatch Fix","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
