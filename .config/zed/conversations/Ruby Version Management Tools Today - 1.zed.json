Use `.ruby-version` files in your projects\n2. Consider using Bundler alongside version managers\n3. Keep your version manager updated\n4. Use the latest stable Ruby version for new projects\n\nI personally recommend **rbenv** if you're primarily working with Ruby, or **asdf** if you work with multiple programming languages and want a single tool to manage them all.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":23}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":56,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":24}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":1451,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":25}}}],"summary":"Ruby Version Management Tools Today","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
