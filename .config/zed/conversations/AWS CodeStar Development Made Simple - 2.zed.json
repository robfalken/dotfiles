It's like having a project manager who has already organized everything for you!\n\nHere's what CodeStar does:\n\n1. Project Templates üèóÔ∏è\n- Gives you ready-to-use templates for popular languages (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.)\n- Helps you start coding quickly without worrying about infrastructure setup\n\n2. Development Tools Integration üõ†Ô∏è\n- Connects with common tools like:\n  - Git for source control\n  - Jenkins for continuous integration\n  - AWS CodeBuild for building your code\n  - AWS CodeDeploy for deployment\n\n3. Team Management üë•\n- Helps manage who can access your project\n- Makes it easy to add team members and set their permissions\n\n4. Project Dashboard üìä\n- Shows you everything about your project in one place\n- Displays metrics, deployment status, and team activity\n\nReal-world example:\nLet's say you want to build a simple web application:\n1.
