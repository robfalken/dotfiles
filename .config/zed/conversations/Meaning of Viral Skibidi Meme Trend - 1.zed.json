The term itself originally comes from a 2018 Russian dance song \"Skibidi\" by Little Big, though in its current meme usage, it doesn't have a specific literal meaning.\n\nIn the context of the viral meme culture, \"skibidi\" is often used as a nonsense word associated with these TV-headed characters and related content, which became popular on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. The meme spawned various catchphrases like \"skibidi toilet\" and \"skibidi dop dop yes yes.\"\nWhat about \"Sigma\"?\n\"Sigma\" or \"Sigma male\" is a term that emerged from internet culture and social media, particularly in discussions about male personality types and behavior patterns. It's an extension of the \"alpha/beta male\" concept, but with some key differences:\n\nKey characteristics associated with \"Sigma\":\n\n1. Independent/lone wolf mentality\n2. Operating outside traditional social hierarchies\n3. Self-reliant and self-motivated\n4. Focused on personal goals rather than social status\n5. Often portrayed as introverted but confident\n\nThe term has become a popular internet meme, often used in:\n- \"Sigma male grindset\" memes\n- Social media content about masculinity\n- Videos and posts about success mindsets\n- Ironic or humorous content poking fun at the concept\n\nWhile some people take the concept seriously, it's important to note that the \"sigma male\" terminology isn't based on scientific research and is often used satirically or as part of internet culture and memes.\n\nThe term has evolved to sometimes simply mean someone who's focused, determined, or doesn't follow conventional social norms, though usage varies depending on context.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":71}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":27,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":72}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":668,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":73}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":58},"start":688,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":74}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":59},"start":1819,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":75}}}],"summary":"Meaning of Viral Skibidi Meme Trend","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
