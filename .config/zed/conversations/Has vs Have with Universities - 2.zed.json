In English, singular subjects take singular verbs, so we use \"has\" rather than \"have.\"\n\nNote: There is a difference between American and British English usage when referring to collective nouns. In British English, it's sometimes acceptable to use plural verbs with collective nouns when emphasizing the individual members of the group. However, when referring to an institution like a university as a single entity, \"has\" is still the standard usage in both American and British English.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":56}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":92,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":57}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":792,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":58}}}],"summary":"Has vs Have with Universities","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
