Basic INSERT with SELECT:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, column3)\nSELECT column1, column2, column3\nFROM source_table\nWHERE some_condition;\n```\n\n2. INSERT with column transformation:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, calculated_column)\nSELECT \n    s.column1,\n    s.column2,\n    CASE \n        WHEN s.some_value > 100 THEN 'High'\n        ELSE 'Low'\n    END as calculated_column\nFROM source_table s\nWHERE s.active = true;\n```\n\n3. INSERT with multiple table joins:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (user_id, order_total, category)\nSELECT \n    u.id,\n    SUM(o.amount),\n    c.category_name\nFROM users u\nJOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id\nJOIN categories c ON o.category_id = c.id\nGROUP BY u.id, c.category_name;\n```\n\n4. INSERT with RETURNING clause (useful for getting inserted IDs):\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2)\nSELECT column1, column2\nFROM source_table\nWHERE condition\nRETURNING id, column1;\n```\n\nBest Practices and Tips:\n\n1. Use transactions for safety:\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nINSERT INTO target_table (...)\nSELECT ...\nFROM source_table\nWHERE ...;\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n2. Check for duplicates before inserting:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2)\nSELECT column1, column2\nFROM source_table s\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM target_table t \n    WHERE t.column1 = s.column1\n);\n```\n\n3. Using WITH clause for more complex queries:\n```sql\nWITH filtered_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        column1,\n        column2,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) as rn\n    FROM source_table\n    WHERE some_condition\n)\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2)\nSELECT column1, column2\nFROM filtered_data\nWHERE rn = 1;\n```\n\n4. Handling conflicts with ON CONFLICT:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (unique_column, data_column)\nSELECT unique_column, data_column\nFROM source_table\nON CONFLICT (unique_column) \nDO UPDATE SET data_column = EXCLUDED.data_column;\n```\n\nPerformance Considerations:\n\n1. For large datasets, consider batching:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2)\nSELECT column1, column2\nFROM source_table\nWHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10000;\n```\n\n2. Create indexes after bulk insert:\n```sql\n-- Drop indexes before insert\nDROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_target_column1;\n\n-- Perform insert\nINSERT INTO target_table ...\n\n-- Recreate indexes after insert\nCREATE INDEX idx_target_column1 ON target_table(column1);\n```\n\n3. Monitor performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE:\n```sql\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE\nINSERT INTO target_table (...)\nSELECT ...\nFROM source_table;\n```\n\nError Handling:\n\n```sql\nDO $$\nBEGIN\n    INSERT INTO target_table (...)\n    SELECT ...\n    FROM source_table;\nEXCEPTION\n    WHEN unique_violation THEN\n        -- Handle duplicate key violations\n        RAISE NOTICE 'Duplicate key violation occurred';\n    WHEN OTHERS THEN\n        -- Handle other errors\n        RAISE NOTICE 'An error occurred: %', SQLERRM;\nEND $$;\n```\n\nThese patterns should cover most common scenarios for inserting data from subqueries. Choose the appropriate pattern based on your specific needs regarding data consistency, performance, and error handling requirements.\nCan I also create join releationships in the same query?\nYes, absolutely! You can include complex joins in your INSERT...SELECT queries. Here are several practical examples with different types of joins and relationships:\n\n1. Basic Join Relationships:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO order_summaries (user_id, total_orders, total_amount)\nSELECT \n    u.id,\n    COUNT(o.id),\n    SUM(o.amount)\nFROM users u\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id\nGROUP BY u.id;\n```\n\n2. Multiple Table Joins:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO product_analytics (\n    product_id, \n    category_name, \n    total_sales, \n    supplier_country\n)\nSELECT \n    p.id,\n    c.name AS category_name,\n    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sales,\n    s.country AS supplier_country\nFROM products p\nJOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id\nLEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id\nJOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.id\nGROUP BY p.id, c.name, s.country;\n```\n\n3. Using Different Join Types:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO customer_status (\n    customer_id,\n    last_order_date,\n    total_spent,\n    loyalty_tier\n)\nSELECT \n    c.id,\n    MAX(o.order_date),\n    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0),\n    lt.tier_name\nFROM customers c\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id\nLEFT JOIN loyalty_tiers lt ON c.loyalty_points BETWEEN lt.min_points AND lt.max_points\nGROUP BY c.id, lt.tier_name;\n```\n\n4. Using Subqueries in Joins:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO sales_report (department_id, employee_count, total_sales)\nSELECT \n    d.id,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e WHERE e.dept_id = d.id),\n    COALESCE(SUM(s.amount), 0)\nFROM departments d\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT \n        e.dept_id,\n        SUM(o.amount) as amount\n    FROM employees e\n    JOIN orders o ON e.id = o.employee_id\n    GROUP BY e.dept_id\n) s ON d.id = s.dept_id\nGROUP BY d.id;\n```\n\n5. Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) with Joins:\n```sql\nWITH monthly_sales AS (\n    SELECT \n        product_id,\n        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) as month,\n        SUM(quantity) as total_quantity\n    FROM sales\n    GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date)\n),\nproduct_rankings AS (\n    SELECT \n        ms.product_id,\n        p.name,\n        ms.month,\n        ms.total_quantity,\n        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ms.month ORDER BY ms.total_quantity DESC) as rank\n    FROM monthly_sales ms\n    JOIN products p ON ms.product_id = p.id\n)\nINSERT INTO top_products_monthly (\n    month,\n    product_id,\n    product_name,\n    quantity_sold,\n    rank\n)\nSELECT \n    month,\n    product_id,\n    name,\n    total_quantity,\n    rank\nFROM product_rankings\nWHERE rank <= 10;\n```\n\n6. Self-Joins:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO employee_hierarchy (\n    employee_id,\n    employee_name,\n    manager_name,\n    department_name,\n    level\n)\nSELECT \n    e1.id,\n    e1.name,\n    e2.name as manager_name,\n    d.name as department_name,\n    COUNT(e2.id) OVER (PARTITION BY e1.id) as hierarchy_level\nFROM employees e1\nLEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id\nJOIN departments d ON e1.department_id = d.id;\n```\n\n7. Using LATERAL Joins (for row-by-row processing):\n```sql\nINSERT INTO order_metrics (\n    order_id,\n    total_items,\n    most_expensive_item\n)\nSELECT \n    o.id,\n    COUNT(oi.id),\n    (\n        SELECT item_name \n        FROM order_items oi2 \n        WHERE oi2.order_id = o.id \n        ORDER BY price DESC \n        LIMIT 1\n    )\nFROM orders o\nLEFT JOIN LATERAL (\n    SELECT id \n    FROM order_items \n    WHERE order_id = o.id\n) oi ON true;\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. Always use appropriate indexes for join columns:\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_order_items_product_id ON order_items(product_id);\n```\n\n2. Use transactions for data consistency:\n```sql\nBEGIN;\n    INSERT INTO target_table (...)\n    SELECT ... \n    FROM table1\n    JOIN table2 ON ...;\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n3. Consider performance with large datasets:\n```sql\n-- Use WHERE clauses to limit joined data\nINSERT INTO target_table (...)\nSELECT ...\nFROM large_table1 l1\nJOIN large_table2 l2 ON l1.id = l2.id\nWHERE l1.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month';\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how you can combine complex join relationships with INSERT...SELECT statements. Choose the appropriate join type (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) based on your data requirements and be mindful of performance implications when joining large tables.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":235}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":2105,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":236}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":5330,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":237}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":74},"start":5387,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":238}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":9610,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":239}}}],"summary":"Postgres Insert From Select Query","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":2037},"icon":"Library","label":"Engineering","metadata":null}]}
