I'll walk you through the process step-by-step.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A Keychron Q3 keyboard\n- USB-C cable\n- A computer with internet access\n- Basic command line familiarity\n\n## Step 1: Set Up the QMK Environment\n\nFirst, you'll need to set up the QMK development environment:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the QMK firmware repository\ngit clone https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git\ncd qmk_firmware\n\n# Install QMK dependencies\npython3 -m pip install --user qmk\nqmk setup\n```\n\n## Step 2: Prepare Your Keymap\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. **Use QMK Configurator (Beginner-Friendly)**\n   - Visit [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/)\n   - Select \"keychron/q3\" from the keyboard dropdown\n   - Design your layout and download the JSON file\n   - Use `qmk compile` to build the firmware\n\n2. **Manual Keymap Creation (Advanced)**\n   - Navigate to keymaps folder:\n   ```bash\n   cd keyboards/keychron/q3/keymaps\n   cp -r default your_keymap_name\n   ```\n   - Edit `your_keymap_name/keymap.c` with your preferred text editor\n\n## Step 3: Compile the Firmware\n\n```bash\n# If using QMK Configurator\nqmk compile path/to/your/downloaded.json\n\n# If creating manual keymap\nqmk compile -kb keychron/q3 -km your_keymap_name\n```\n\nThis will generate a firmware file (`.bin` format) in the root QMK directory.\n\n## Step 4: Put Keyboard in Bootloader Mode\n\n1. Unplug your keyboard\n2. Hold the `Escape` key while plugging in the USB-C cable\n   - Alternatively, look for a small reset button on the bottom of the keyboard and press it with a paperclip while the keyboard is connected\n\n## Step 5: Flash the Firmware\n\nUsing QMK Toolbox (GUI Method):\n1. Download [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases)\n2. Open QMK Toolbox and select your `.bin` file\n3. Ensure \"Auto-Flash\" is checked\n4. Put keyboard in bootloader mode (previous step)\n5. Click \"Flash\"\n\nUsing Command Line:\n```bash\nqmk flash -kb keychron/q3 -km your_keymap_name\n# Or with a specific file\nqmk flash path/to/your/firmware.bin\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If your keyboard isn't detected in bootloader mode, try a different USB port or cable\n- Ensure you're using the correct keyboard model in QMK (Keychron Q3)\n- For Windows users, you may need to install drivers for the bootloader\n- If flashing fails, try putting the keyboard back in bootloader mode and retry\n\n## Final Notes\n\n- Always keep a backup of your original firmware if possible\n- Document your keymap changes for future reference\n- Join the QMK Discord or forums if you need more specific help\n\nThis process should work with the Keychron Q3, but note that specific details might vary slightly based on your exact Q3 version and your operating system.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":92}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":38},"start":1409,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":93}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":39},"start":4208,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":94}}}],"summary":"Keychron Q3 QMK Flashing Guide","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
