Color Space Differences\n- Figma uses RGB color space for web/digital display\n- Sometimes when copying colors between programs, you might be switching between RGB and other color spaces (like CMYK), which can cause shifts\n- Different software might interpret the same hex value slightly differently\n\n2. Display Settings\n- Your monitor's calibration settings can affect how colors appear\n- Color profiles on different devices may vary\n- Brightness and contrast settings can impact color perception\n\n3. Color Blending Modes\n- If your color is part of a layer with blending modes or opacity settings in Figma, the hex value you copy might be the \"raw\" color, not the final appearance\n- Overlapping transparent layers can create perceived colors that don't match the actual hex value\n\nTo ensure color consistency:\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Double-check that you're copying the final computed color value, not just the base color\n2. Use Figma's Inspect panel to verify the exact color values\n3. Consider creating a color system with variables to maintain consistency\n4. Test colors across different devices and browsers\n5. Use modern color notation like RGB or HSL when more precision is needed\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide specific examples of how to troubleshoot color inconsistencies in your workflow?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":42}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1003,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":43}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":2540,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}}],"summary":"Color Discrepancies Between Design Tools","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":931},"icon":"Library","label":"Creative Director","metadata":null}]}
