Considering there might be dates without any leads for a certain campaign_id\n# PostgreSQL Query for Average Monthly Leads by Campaign\n\nTo calculate the average number of leads per month for each campaign since January 1, 2025, while accounting for months that might have zero leads, I'll create a solution that:\n\n1. Generates a series of all months in the date range\n2. Cross joins with all campaign IDs\n3. Left joins with actual lead data to include months with zero leads\n4. Calculates the monthly averages\n\nHere's a production-ready solution:\n\n```sql\nWITH date_series AS (\n  SELECT generate_series(\n    '2025-01-01'::date,\n    CURRENT_DATE,\n    interval '1 month'\n  )::date AS month_start\n),\nmonth_ranges AS (\n  SELECT \n    month_start,\n    (month_start + interval '1 month' - interval '1 day')::date AS month_end\n  FROM date_series\n),\ncampaigns AS (\n  SELECT DISTINCT campaign_id \n  FROM leads\n  WHERE created_at >= '2025-01-01'\n),\ncampaign_months AS (\n  SELECT \n    c.campaign_id,\n    m.month_start,\n    m.month_end,\n    to_char(m.month_start, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_label\n  FROM campaigns c\n  CROSS JOIN month_ranges m\n),\nmonthly_counts AS (\n  SELECT \n    cm.campaign_id,\n    cm.month_label,\n    COUNT(l.id) AS lead_count\n  FROM campaign_months cm\n  LEFT JOIN leads l ON l.campaign_id = cm.campaign_id\n                    AND l.created_at >= cm.month_start\n                    AND l.created_at <= cm.month_end\n  GROUP BY cm.campaign_id, cm.month_label, cm.month_start\n  ORDER BY cm.campaign_id, cm.month_start\n)\nSELECT \n  campaign_id,\n  AVG(lead_count) AS avg_monthly_leads,\n  COUNT(*) AS months_counted,\n  MIN(lead_count) AS min_leads,\n  MAX(lead_count) AS max_leads\nFROM monthly_counts\nGROUP BY campaign_id\nORDER BY campaign_id;\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. `date_series`: Generates a row for each month starting from 2025-01-01 to the current date.\n\n2. `month_ranges`: Calculates the start and end date of each month.\n\n3. `campaigns`: Gets the distinct campaign IDs that have at least one lead since 2025-01-01.\n\n4. `campaign_months`: Creates a cartesian product of all campaigns and all months, ensuring we have a row for every campaign-month combination.\n\n5. `monthly_counts`: Left joins the actual lead data to count leads per campaign per month. The LEFT JOIN ensures months with zero leads are included.\n\n6. The final query calculates the average monthly leads for each campaign, along with supplementary statistics.\n\n## Notes for Production Use\n\n- This query handles gaps in data (months with no leads)\n- The approach will work correctly even if new campaigns are added over time\n- If you have millions of leads, consider adding appropriate indexes:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE INDEX idx_leads_campaign_created ON leads(campaign_id, created_at);\n  ```\n- For very large datasets, you might want to materialize intermediate results to improve performance\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have specific requirements not covered by this solution!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":185}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":111},"start":1612,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":186}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":112},"start":4488,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":187}}}],"summary":"Postgres Leads Monthly Average Query","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
