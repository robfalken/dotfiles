Let's approach this:\n\n## Solution Using JSON_OBJECT_AGG\n\nThe most elegant solution is to use `json_object_agg()`, which was designed specifically for this purpose:\n\n```sql\nSELECT json_object_agg(short_id, content) AS result\nFROM your_table;\n```\n\nThis will produce a single JSON object where each `short_id` serves as a key with its corresponding `content` as the value.\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\n### Using JSON_BUILD_OBJECT and JSON_AGG\n\nIf you need more control over the construction:\n\n```sql\nSELECT jsonb_object_agg(short_id, content) AS result\nFROM your_table;\n```\n\n### Using JSONB_OBJECT_AGG for JSONB output\n\nIf you specifically need JSONB format (which is likely since your content is already JSONB):\n\n```sql\nSELECT jsonb_object_agg(short_id, content) AS result\nFROM your_table;\n```\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n### Performance for Large Tables\n\nFor large tables, this operation can be expensive as it builds a single large JSON object. Consider:\n\n```sql\n-- Add a WHERE clause if you don't need all records\nSELECT jsonb_object_agg(short_id, content) AS result\nFROM your_table\nWHERE some_condition;\n```\n\n### Handling Duplicate Keys\n\nIf you have duplicate `short_id` values, the last one processed will overwrite earlier entries. To handle this deliberately:\n\n```sql\n-- Using DISTINCT ON to ensure unique keys\nSELECT jsonb_object_agg(short_id, content) AS result\nFROM (\n  SELECT DISTINCT ON (short_id) short_id, content\n  FROM your_table\n  ORDER BY short_id, created_at DESC  -- Assuming you have a timestamp column\n) unique_records;\n```\n\n### Filtering Content\n\nIf you need to filter or transform the content:\n\n```sql\nSELECT jsonb_object_agg(short_id, filtered_content) AS result\nFROM (\n  SELECT short_id, content->'specific_field' AS filtered_content\n  FROM your_table\n) filtered;\n```\n\nThis approach gives you a clean, single JSON object with your desired key-value mapping structure.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":68}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":1561,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":69}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":63},"start":3644,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":70}}}],"summary":"Postgres JSON aggregation using short_id","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
