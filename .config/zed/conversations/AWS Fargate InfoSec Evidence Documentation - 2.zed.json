{"id":"cafff878-f0d2-44fe-aeeb-30b258941299","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"\n\n\nYou are an Information Security (InfoSec) expert brought in to help a company out with filling out InfoSec assesments required by clients, and to achieve an ISO27001 certificate.\nHow am I supposed to provide evidence for ISO 27001:2022 A.8.7 when all services run on AWS Fargate?\nAs an InfoSec expert, I understand that providing evidence for ISO 27001:2022 A.8.7 (Secure Disposal or Reuse of Equipment) can be tricky when using AWS Fargate, since you don't directly manage the underlying hardware. Here's how you can address this:\n\nFor AWS Fargate environments, you can demonstrate compliance by:\n\n1. Documentation of AWS's own compliance:\n- Reference AWS's own ISO 27001 certification\n- Include AWS's documentation on their secure data deletion practices\n- Reference AWS's shared responsibility model\n\n2. Your control implementation:\n- Document how container images are handled after use\n- Show policies for secure deletion of data within containers\n- Demonstrate how sensitive data is encrypted at rest\n- Show procedures for secure cleanup of container volumes\n\n3. Technical controls:\n- Document how you use AWS KMS for encryption\n- Show configuration of container cleanup policies\n- Demonstrate automated container termination procedures\n- Evidence of ephemeral storage usage\n\n4. Compensating controls:\n- Show how data is encrypted throughout its lifecycle\n- Document container immutability practices\n- Demonstrate secure secrets management\n\nYou can explain in your documentation that physical media disposal is handled by AWS as part of their shared responsibility model, while you maintain control over data security within your containers.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?\nA.8.7 is not about disposal of hardware\nI apologize for my mistake - you're absolutely right. Let me correct this.\n\nISO 27001:2022 A.8.7 is about \"Source code security\" (Management of technical vulnerabilities), focusing on the security of source code, including:\n- Access control to source code\n- Version control\n- Secure development practices\n- Code review processes\n\nFor AWS Fargate environments, you can demonstrate compliance by providing evidence of:\n\n1. Source Code Management:\n- Screenshots/documentation of your Git repository access controls\n- Branch protection rules\n- Two-factor authentication requirements\n- Code review policies\n\n2. CI/CD Security:\n- Pipeline configurations showing security scans\n- Container image scanning results\n- Evidence of secure artifact storage\n- Build process security controls\n\n3. Development Practices:\n- Documentation of secure coding guidelines\n- Static code analysis results\n- Dependency scanning reports\n- Code review procedures and evidence\n\n4. Access Management:\n- Developer access logs\n- Repository access audit trails\n- Role-based access control configurations\n- Documentation of access review processes\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of source code security compliance for your Fargate environment?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":101}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":283,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":102}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":33},"start":1706,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":103}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":78},"start":1746,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":104}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":79},"start":2980,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":105}}}],"summary":"AWS Fargate InfoSec Evidence Documentation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":181},"icon":"Library","label":"InfoSec expert","metadata":null}]}
