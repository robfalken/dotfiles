The \"Did you mean to import 'react/jsx-runtime.js'?\" error suggests that you're using the new JSX Transform (introduced in React 17) but your test environment isn't properly set up for it.\n\n## What's Happening\n\nReact 17 introduced a new JSX Transform that doesn't require importing React in every file using JSX. Instead, it uses `react/jsx-runtime`. Your build configuration appears to be using this new transform, but Vitest might not be properly configured to handle it.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. Update your Vitest configuration\n\nIn your `vitest.config.ts` or `vite.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n    globals: true,\n    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'], // Your setup file if you have one\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    conditions: ['development', 'browser'],\n  },\n  // Ensure jsx is properly configured\n  esbuild: {\n    jsx: 'automatic',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### 2. Check your babel/tsconfig configuration\n\nMake sure your babel config or tsconfig.json is properly set up for the new JSX transform:\n\nIn `tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n    // other options...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr in babel configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"@babel/preset-react\", {\n      \"runtime\": \"automatic\"\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Ensure consistent React versions\n\nMake sure you're using consistent React versions across your dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm ls react react-dom\n```\n\nIf you see multiple versions, you might need to update or enforce consistent versions.\n\n### 4. Add explicit imports as a workaround\n\nIf the above doesn't work, you can explicitly import React in your test or component files:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return <div>Hello</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\nIf you're still facing issues:\n\n1. Check if you're mixing different JSX transform approaches in your project.\n2. Verify that your test files are being processed by the same transformers as your source files.\n3. Try adding a simple test file with explicit React imports to see if that works.\n4. Examine your `node_modules` to ensure there aren't duplicate React installations.\n\nThis error is typically configuration-related rather than an issue with your actual code. With the right configuration adjustments, you should be able to resolve it.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":184}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":1352,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":185}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":86},"start":1485,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":186}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":87},"start":4026,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":187}}}],"summary":"React JSX Runtime Import Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
