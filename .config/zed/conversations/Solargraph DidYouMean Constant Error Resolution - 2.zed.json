Solargraph is a language server that provides code completion and documentation for Ruby.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve this:\n\n1. First, try reinstalling Solargraph:\n\n```bash\ngem uninstall solargraph\ngem install solargraph\n```\n\n2. If that doesn't work, check your Ruby version and make sure you're using a compatible version of Solargraph. You can specify a version in your Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'solargraph', '~> 0.49.0'  # Use a recent stable version\n```\n\n3. Make sure your project's `.solargraph.yml` configuration is correct. Create or update it in your project root:\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  - '**/*.rb'\nreporters:\n  - rubocop\nrequire:\n  - yard\n  - rubocop\nplugins: []\nmax_files: 5000\n```\n\n4. If you're using Bundler, try running Solargraph through it:\n\n```bash\nbundle exec solargraph socket\n```\n\n5. If the issue persists, try clearing Solargraph's cache:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ~/.solargraph\nsolargraph clear\n```\n\n6. Check if you have the `did_you_mean` gem installed (it should come with Ruby):\n\n```bash\ngem list did_you_mean\n```\n\nIf it's missing, you can install it:\n\n```bash\ngem install did_you_mean\n```\n\nIf none of these steps work, please provide:\n- Your Ruby version (`ruby -v`)\n- Your Solargraph version (`solargraph --version`)\n- The contents of your Gemfile if you're using one\n- The editor/IDE you're using with Solargraph\n\nThis will help pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":2087,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":33}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":2149,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":34}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":3675,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":35}}}],"summary":"Solargraph DidYouMean Constant Error Resolution","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":2037},"icon":"Library","label":"Engineering","metadata":null}]}
