Here are its key aspects:\n\n1. Purpose:\n- Provides the communication between display servers and their clients\n- Handles input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen)\n- Manages the display of windows and their contents\n- Coordinates graphics rendering\n\n2. Key Features:\n- Modern, simpler architecture compared to X11\n- Better security through client isolation\n- Improved performance and reduced latency\n- Better support for modern graphics hardware\n- Smoother handling of HiDPI displays\n- More efficient window management\n\n3. Advantages:\n- More efficient rendering\n- Better security model\n- Reduced screen tearing\n- Better support for modern hardware features\n- Simplified codebase compared to X11\n\n4. Current Status:\n- Increasingly adopted by major Linux distributions\n- Default display server in many modern Linux distributions\n- Used by GNOME and KDE Plasma desktop environments\n\nWayland represents the future of display server technology in Linux, offering improvements in performance, security, and functionality compared to the legacy X11 system.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":27}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":20,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":1224,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}}}],"summary":"Understanding the Wayland Display Protocol System","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
