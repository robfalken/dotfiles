Here are a few common approaches:\n\n1. Reading as text:\n```rust\nuse reqwest;\n\nasync fn get_content() -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {\n    let response = reqwest::get(\"https://example.com\").await?;\n    let text = response.text().await?;\n    Ok(text)\n}\n```\n\n2. Reading as bytes:\n```rust\nasync fn get_bytes() -> Result<bytes::Bytes, reqwest::Error> {\n    let response = reqwest::get(\"https://example.com\").await?;\n    let bytes = response.bytes().await?;\n    Ok(bytes)\n}\n```\n\n3. Reading as JSON:\n```rust\nuse serde::Deserialize;\n\n#[derive(Deserialize)]\nstruct Data {\n    field: String,\n}\n\nasync fn get_json() -> Result<Data, reqwest::Error> {\n    let response = reqwest::get(\"https://example.com\").await?;\n    let data = response.json::<Data>().await?;\n    Ok(data)\n}\n```\n\n4. Reading the body as a stream:\n```rust\nuse futures_util::StreamExt;\n\nasync fn read_stream() -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {\n    let response = reqwest::get(\"https://example.com\").await?;\n    let mut stream = response.bytes_stream();\n    \n    while let Some(item) = stream.next().await {\n        let chunk = item?;\n        // Process each chunk of bytes\n        println!(\"Chunk size: {}\", chunk.len());\n    }\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs:\n- Use `.text()` for text content\n- Use `.bytes()` for raw byte content\n- Use `.json()` for JSON content that can be deserialized into a struct\n- Use `.bytes_stream()` for streaming large responses\n\nRemember that these methods consume the response body, so you can only call one of them once per response.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle errors appropriately in your actual code:\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let response = reqwest::get(\"https://example.com\").await?;\n    let content = response.text().await?;\n    println!(\"Content: {}\", content);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":320}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":65,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":321}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":2065,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":322}}}],"summary":"Reading Response AsyncBody Content Rust","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
