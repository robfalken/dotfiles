How can I open it anyway?\nYou can open an unverified PKG file on macOS in a few ways:\n\n1. Right-click (or Control-click) the PKG file and select \"Open\" instead of double-clicking. When prompted, click \"Open\" again.\n\n2. If that doesn't work:\n- Go to System Settings/Preferences > Security & Privacy\n- Look for a message about the blocked package\n- Click \"Open Anyway\" or \"Allow\"\n\n3. If still blocked, you can temporarily adjust security settings:\n- Go to System Settings/Preferences > Security & Privacy\n- Under \"Allow apps downloaded from:\"\n- Select \"App Store and identified developers\" or temporarily select \"Anywhere\"\n\nRemember to only open PKG files from sources you trust, as this verification system helps protect your Mac from malware.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":95,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":54}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":812,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}}],"summary":"Opening Unverified PKG File on Mac","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
