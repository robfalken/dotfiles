For small arrays (< 100 elements), `IN` and `ANY` perform similarly\n   - For larger arrays, `ANY` with array parameters typically performs better\n\n3. **Batch Size**: If querying thousands of IDs, consider splitting into multiple queries of 500-1000 IDs each\n\n## Production-ready Example in Rails\n\n```ruby\nclass Lead < ApplicationRecord\n  # Class method to efficiently fetch leads by ID batches\n  def self.find_in_batches_by_ids(ids, batch_size: 1000)\n    ids.each_slice(batch_size) do |id_batch|\n      # Using ANY for more efficient querying with larger arrays\n      batch = where(\"id = ANY(ARRAY[?]::integer[])\", id_batch)\n      \n      # Preserve original order if important\n      ordered_batch = batch.index_by(&:id).values_at(*id_batch).compact\n      \n      yield ordered_batch if block_given?\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Usage\nlead_ids = [1, 2, 3, ..., 10000]\nLead.find_in_batches_by_ids(lead_ids) do |batch|\n  # Process each batch\nend\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient, handles large ID arrays gracefully, and maintains the original order of the IDs when that matters.\nI want to use pure postgres query, and the IDs are UUID\n# Querying Leads by Array of UUIDs in PostgreSQL\n\nSince you're working with UUIDs rather than integers and want a pure PostgreSQL solution, here are the proper approaches:\n\n## Basic Approach: Using IN Operator\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM leads WHERE id IN ('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', \n                                 '223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',\n                                 '323e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000');\n```\n\n## For Large Arrays: Using ANY Operator with UUID Array\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM leads \nWHERE id = ANY(ARRAY[\n  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'::uuid,\n  '223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'::uuid,\n  '323e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'::uuid\n]);\n```\n\nThe explicit type casting to `uuid` is important for performance since it allows PostgreSQL to use the proper index.\n\n## Using UUID Array as a Parameter\n\nIf you're using a prepared statement or passing the array as a parameter:\n\n```sql\n-- As a prepared statement\nPREPARE lead_query AS SELECT * FROM leads WHERE id = ANY($1::uuid[]);\nEXECUTE lead_query(ARRAY[\n  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',\n  '223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',\n  '323e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'\n]::uuid[]);\n```\n\n## Creating a Temporary Table for Very Large Sets\n\nFor very large sets of UUIDs (thousands), a temporary table approach can sometimes be more efficient:\n\n```sql\n-- Create temporary table\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_lead_ids (id uuid PRIMARY KEY);\n\n-- Insert UUID values\nINSERT INTO temp_lead_ids (id) VALUES \n  ('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'),\n  ('223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'),\n  ('323e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000');\n\n-- Join with the lead table\nSELECT leads.* \nFROM leads\nJOIN temp_lead_ids ON leads.id = temp_lead_ids.id;\n\n-- Clean up\nDROP TABLE temp_lead_ids;\n```\n\n## Performance Guidelines for UUID Arrays\n\n1. **Explicit Typing**: Always use the `::uuid` type casting when working with UUID arrays\n2. **Index Usage**: Ensure your query plan uses the index on the UUID field (use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`)\n3. **Batch Size**: For very large arrays (>1000 elements), consider the temporary table approach\n\n## Complete Example with Parameter Binding\n\nIf you're using a function or prepared statement with a parameter for the UUID array:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_leads_by_ids(uuid_array uuid[])\nRETURNS SETOF leads AS $$\nBEGIN\n  RETURN QUERY\n  SELECT * FROM leads WHERE id = ANY(uuid_array);\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Usage:\nSELECT * FROM get_leads_by_ids(ARRAY[\n  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',\n  '223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'\n]::uuid[]);\n```\n\nThis function provides a clean interface for querying by UUID arrays while ensuring proper typing.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":164}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":1428,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":165}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":3753,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":166}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":116},"start":3809,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":167}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":117},"start":6509,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":168}}}],"summary":"Querying Leads by Multiple IDs","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
