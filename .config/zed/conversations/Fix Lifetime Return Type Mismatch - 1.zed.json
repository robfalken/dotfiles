Here are a few ways to fix this:\n\n1. If you don't need the reference, you can clone the consumer:\n\n```rust\nfn get_consumer(&self, queue: String) -> Option<Box<dyn Consumer>> {\n    let consumer = self.consumers.get(&queue);\n    match consumer {\n        Some(consumer) => {\n            info!(\"Found consumer\");\n            Some(consumer.clone())\n        }\n        None => None,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. If `Consumer` implements `Clone`, you can use:\n\n```rust\nfn get_consumer(&self, queue: String) -> Option<Box<dyn Consumer>> {\n    self.consumers.get(&queue).cloned()\n}\n```\n\n3. If you really need a reference, you can change the lifetime parameters:\n\n```rust\nfn get_consumer(&self, queue: String) -> Option<&Box<dyn Consumer>> {\n    self.consumers.get(&queue)\n}\n```\n\nThe first approach (cloning) is probably the most straightforward if you don't specifically need a reference. However, the best solution depends on:\n\n1. Whether `Consumer` implements `Clone`\n2. Whether you need ownership or just a reference\n3. The performance requirements of your application\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your specific needs.\n\nIf performance is critical and you want to avoid cloning, you might want to reconsider your design to avoid the lifetime issues, perhaps by using reference counting (`Arc`) or other ownership patterns.\nI  really need the reference, but I can't see any lifetimes in your second example\nThe second example doesn't show explicit lifetimes because Rust can elide (automatically infer) them in simple cases. The full signature with explicit lifetimes would be:\n\n```rust\nfn get_consumer<'a>(&'a self, queue: String) -> Option<&'a Box<dyn Consumer>> {\n    self.consumers.get(&queue)\n}\n```\n\nThis works because:\n1. The reference returned has the same lifetime as the `&self` parameter\n2. We're not trying to extend the lifetime beyond what's available\n3. We're returning a reference to something that's definitely owned by `self`\n\nThe version you had was problematic because it was trying to tie the returned reference's lifetime to a lifetime parameter of the struct (`'a`), which could potentially be longer than the actual reference to `self`. The fixed version simply says \"the returned reference lives exactly as long as this borrow of `self`.\"\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":102}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":538,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":103}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":1973,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":104}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":59},"start":2056,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":105}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":60},"start":2912,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":106}}}],"summary":"Fix Lifetime Return Type Mismatch","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
