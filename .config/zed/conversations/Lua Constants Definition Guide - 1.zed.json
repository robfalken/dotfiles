However, there are several common conventions and approaches to implement constant-like behavior:\n\n1. Using uppercase naming convention (Most common):\n```lua\nlocal MAX_PLAYERS = 10\nlocal PI = 3.14159\n```\n\n2. Using a table with constants:\n```lua\nlocal Constants = {\n    MAX_PLAYERS = 10,\n    GAME_NAME = \"My Game\",\n    PI = 3.14159\n}\n```\n\n3. Using metatables to prevent modification (more advanced):\n```lua\nlocal Constants = {\n    MAX_PLAYERS = 10,\n    GAME_NAME = \"My Game\"\n}\n\n-- Make the table read-only\nsetmetatable(Constants, {\n    __newindex = function(table, key, value)\n        error(\"Attempting to modify read-only table\")\n    end\n})\n```\n\n4. Using local variables in a module:\n```lua\n-- constants.lua\nlocal M = {}\n\nM.MAX_PLAYERS = 10\nM.GAME_NAME = \"My Game\"\n\nreturn M\n\n-- main.lua\nlocal Constants = require(\"constants\")\n```\n\nThe most common and simplest approach is using the uppercase naming convention (#1). While this doesn't prevent the value from being changed, it clearly communicates to other developers that these values should be treated as constants.\n\nThe metatable approach (#3) provides actual protection against modification, but it's more complex and typically unnecessary unless you really need to prevent modifications.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":19}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":37,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":20}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":1382,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":21}}}],"summary":"Lua Constants Definition Guide","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
