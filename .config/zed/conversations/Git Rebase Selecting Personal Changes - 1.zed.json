If you're in the rebase interactive editor (where you see pick, squash, etc.), you can simply keep \"pick\" for all commits you want to keep:\n\n```\npick abc1234 First commit\npick def5678 Second commit\npick ghi9012 Third commit\n```\n\n2. If you want to automatically accept all your changes during a rebase conflict, you can use:\n\n```bash\ngit rebase --continue\n```\nor\n```bash\ngit rebase -X ours\n```\n\n3. If you haven't started the rebase yet and want to keep all your changes, you might not need to rebase at all. You could just:\n```bash\ngit pull --rebase\n```\n\nRemember:\n- \"pick\" means keep the commit as-is\n- If you're in the middle of a rebase and want to abort it:\n```bash\ngit rebase --abort\n```\n\nThe safest approach is to make sure you have a backup branch before starting a rebase, so you can always return to your original state if needed.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":66,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":1001,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}}}],"summary":"Git Rebase Selecting Personal Changes","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
