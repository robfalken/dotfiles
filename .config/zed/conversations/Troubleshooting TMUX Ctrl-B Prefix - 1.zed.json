Let me walk you through the most common issues and their solutions:\n\n## 1. Custom tmux.conf Configuration\n\nThe most common reason is that your `.tmux.conf` file has remapped the prefix key:\n\n```bash\n# Check if you have redefined the prefix in your config\ngrep \"prefix\" ~/.tmux.conf\n```\n\nLook for lines like:\n```\nunbind C-b\nset -g prefix C-a  # This would change prefix to Ctrl-a\n```\n\n## 2. Nested Tmux Sessions\n\nIf you're running a tmux session inside another tmux session, the inner session would require you to press the prefix twice:\n\n```\n# For example, if Ctrl-b is your prefix:\nCtrl-b Ctrl-b [command]  # For the inner session\n```\n\nSolution: For nested sessions, consider setting different prefix keys:\n```bash\n# In the inner session's .tmux.conf\nunbind C-b\nset -g prefix C-a\n```\n\n## 3. Terminal Issues\n\nSome terminal emulators might capture Ctrl-b for their own use:\n\n- Check terminal keyboard shortcuts in preferences\n- Try a different terminal application to isolate the issue\n- Ensure your terminal is correctly sending the control sequence\n\n## 4. SSH Connection Problems\n\nIf using tmux over SSH, there could be key binding issues:\n\n```bash\n# Try setting TERM environment variable\nexport TERM=xterm-256color\n```\n\n## 5. Key Binding Conflicts\n\nThe key combination might be captured by another application:\n\n```bash\n# Check all tmux key bindings\ntmux list-keys | grep \"C-b\"\n```\n\n## 6. tmux.conf Syntax Errors\n\nAn error in your configuration file might prevent settings from being applied:\n\n```bash\n# Start tmux with debugging\ntmux -L debug -f /dev/null new-session\n```\n\n## Quick Fix Solution\n\nIf you need a temporary solution to get working immediately:\n\n```bash\n# Start a fresh tmux session without loading config\ntmux -f /dev/null\n\n# Or change prefix temporarily in an existing session\ntmux set-option -g prefix C-a\ntmux bind-key C-a send-prefix\ntmux unbind-key C-b\n```\n\n## Reset Everything\n\nIf all else fails, try with a clean slate:\n\n```bash\nmv ~/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf.backup\n```\n\nThen restart tmux and see if the default Ctrl-b works.\n\nWould you like me to help you debug any specific aspect of this issue in more detail?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":63}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":30},"start":1416,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":64}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":3671,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":65}}}],"summary":"Troubleshooting TMUX Ctrl-B Prefix","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1350},"icon":"Library","label":"Software Engineer","metadata":null}]}
